Simple readme file,

This script is meant as a quick/easy way to set up a Wireguard VPN with DNS using Unbound.  

It was intentionally to run on EC2, but since evolved as Lightsail is a far cheaper alternative.

The script is a bit messy in places, i'll fix that if I get time.  

If it wont run, try breaking it down into blocks and copy/paste. or use bash -x to get a verbose output so you can see whats failing.

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and 18.04 using the cheapest lightsail instance ($3.50/Mo)
